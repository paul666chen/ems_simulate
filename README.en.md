6. **Choose a simulation mode** — random, step, or fixed value

   ![Configure point simulation](resources/img/6.png)

7. **Edit point details** — address, coefficients, decode code, and more

   ![Edit point details](resources/img/7.png)

#### Batch copying, outstations, and connections

Copy one or more devices with configurable name prefixes/suffixes and IP and port offsets. Use outstation management and connection monitoring to check communication status.

> ![](resources/img/device-copy.png)

> ![](resources/img/device-connections.png)

#### Point-list import and export

Configure points in bulk with an Excel template and export point lists. Sample spreadsheets are provided for [Modbus](data/point_csv/point_sample_modbus.xlsx), [IEC 104](data/point_csv/point_sample_iec104.xlsx), [DL/T 645](data/point_csv/point_sample_dlt645.xlsx), and [DNP3](data/point_csv/point_sample_dnp3.xlsx).

![](resources/img/point-import-export.png)

#### Simulation configuration and live monitoring

Choose fixed, random, incrementing, decrementing, sine-wave, ramp, or pulse values. Configure parameters per point and select points for simulation in bulk.

![Point simulation settings](resources/img/simulate-config.png)

![Simulated data monitor](resources/img/simulate-monitor.png)

The client supports single-point, batch, and automatic background reads. Automatic reads continue when you switch pages; their status reappears when you return to the device page. Stopping a device ends its associated tasks.

> ![](resources/img/point-auto-read.png)

#### Point mapping, formulas, and change tracking

Build formulas from multiple source points and map their results to target points, including across devices and protocols. Change history records timestamps, previous and new values, and sources to help trace simulation results and communication writes.

### Protocol modules

The sections below cover configuration, data operations, and message inspection for each protocol. Protocols support **server/outstation** roles (simulated devices) and **client/master** roles (acquisition or control), with specific capabilities described under each module.

#### Modbus TCP / RTU

Modbus is widely used in industrial automation. This application supports both TCP network connections and RTU serial connections.

| Default port | 502 | — (serial) |
| Data operations | Read coils, discrete inputs, holding registers, and input registers; write to writable areas | Same as TCP |
| Decode codes | 8/16/32/64-bit values, byte order, and word swapping | Same as TCP |

##### Device configuration and data operations

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js >= 18
- uv, npm, and Git (some Python protocol dependencies are installed from Git repositories)

### Install dependencies

From the repository root, install Python dependencies and start the backend:

```bash
# If uv is not installed yet: pip install uv
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python start_back_end.py
```

In another terminal, start the frontend from the repository root:

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local address printed by Vite in a browser. See the [configuration guide](docs/guide/install/configuration.md) for backend settings.

### Build the Tauri desktop app

Windows builds require Rust, MSVC build tools, and the Tauri CLI. The repository script builds the frontend, Python backend, and desktop client:

```powershell
# Run from the repository root
uv sync --extra dev --extra build
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli

# Build the Windows installer
.\scripts\build_tauri_windows.ps1
```

The script creates an MSI installer by default. See the [Windows build script](scripts/build_tauri_windows.ps1) for the MSIX entry point and additional tool requirements. For Linux, see the [Debian packaging and deployment guide](docs/guide/install/packaging_deb.md).

## Core concepts

### Point types

The system supports four point types:

| Type | Code | Description | Typical use |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **YC (measurement)** | frame_type=0 | Analog measurement | Voltage, current, power, temperature |
| **YX (indication)** | frame_type=1 | Binary status | Running state, fault flag |
| **YK (control)** | frame_type=2 | Binary command | Start/stop, open/close breaker |
| **YT (setpoint)** | frame_type=3 | Analog command | Power or temperature setpoint |

### Protocol types

| Protocol | Server | Client | Default port |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Modbus TCP | ✅ | ✅ | 502 |
| Modbus RTU | ✅ | ✅ | Serial |
| IEC 60870-5-104 | ✅ | ✅ | 2404 |
| IEC 60870-5-101 | ✅ | ✅ | Serial |
| DL/T 645-2007 | ✅ | ✅ | 8899 |
| DNP3 | ✅ (Outstation) | ✅ (Master) | 20000 |
| IEC 61850 MMS | ✅ | ✅ | 102 |
| IEC 61850 GOOSE | ✅ (publish) | ✅ (subscribe) | — (Ethernet layer 2) |
| IEC 61850 Reports | ✅ | ✅ | Reuses the MMS connection |
| IEC 61850 Files | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| IEC 61850 Setting Groups | ✅ | ✅ | Reuses the MMS connection |
| IEC 61850 Logs | ✅ | ✅ | Reuses the MMS connection |

## Decode-code system

Decode codes specify how Modbus register data is interpreted, including data type, byte order, and bit width.

### Decode codes

Codes use `type-and-width_byte-order` names such as `INT8_AB`, `INT32_CDAB`, and `FLOAT32_CDAB`. The system supports 8/16/32/64-bit integers, 32-bit floats, and IEEE 754 doubles. Double codes are `DOUBLE_ABCDEFGH`, `DOUBLE_BADCFEHG`, `DOUBLE_GHEFCDAB`, and `DOUBLE_HGFEDCBA`. See the [decode-code reference](docs/guide/point/register-parsing.md) for the supported types and byte orders.

### Engineering-value conversion

YC and YT points support coefficient conversion:

```
engineering value = register value × multiplication coefficient + addition coefficient
register value = (engineering value - addition coefficient) ÷ multiplication coefficient
```

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `mul_coe` | Multiplication coefficient | 1.0 |
| `add_coe` | Addition coefficient | 0.0 |

## Development guide

### Add a device type

1. Create a device class under `src/device/types/`.
2. Inherit from the `Device` base class.
3. Optionally implement `setSpecialDataPointValues()`.

```python
from src.device.core.device import Device, DeviceType

class MyDevice(Device):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.device_type = DeviceType.Other

    def setSpecialDataPointValues(self):
        # Define custom point relationships
        pass
```

### Add a protocol

1. Create a handler under `src/device/protocol/`.
2. Inherit from `ServerHandler` or `ClientHandler`.
3. Implement the abstract methods.

```python
from src.device.protocol.base_handler import ServerHandler

class MyProtocolHandler(ServerHandler):
    def initialize(self, config):
        pass

    async def start(self) -> bool:
        self._is_running = True
        return True

    async def stop(self) -> bool:
        self._is_running = False
        return True

    def read_value(self, point):
        pass

    def write_value(self, point, value):
        pass

    def add_points(self, points):
        pass
```
